    "winner": "A",
    "joke_a_score": 7,
    "joke_b_score": 5,
    "reasoning": "A lands a sharper, more coherent absurd twist\u2014personifying the coffee machine to roast procrastination is vivid and timely. B relies on a raspberry/fruit pun that feels forced, and the baby setup can read awkward rather than clever."

    "winner": "A",
    "joke_a_score": 7,
    "joke_b_score": 5,
    "reasoning": "Joke A delivers a sharper surprise with absurd imagery (a coffee machine giving a TED Talk) that ties neatly to procrastination. Joke B is a clever pun on \u201ctake after,\u201d but it reads a bit awkwardly and requires a moment to parse, landing softer."

    "winner": "A",
    "joke_a_score": 8,
    "joke_b_score": 6,
    "reasoning": "Joke A lands a sharp, absurd visual with a relatable self-own and a modern reference; it\u2019s tight and surprising. Joke B has layered wordplay (\u201cback to back\u201d and \u201cstand\u201d), but it leans on a sensitive premise that can feel punch-down and has clunky phrasing, which blunts the laugh."

    "winner": "B",
    "joke_a_score": 7,
    "joke_b_score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Joke B lands a sharper punch with the double meaning of \u201cspeed,\u201d cleverly twisting the idiom into a layered wordplay. Joke A is whimsical and vivid, but the TED Talk trope feels a touch familiar and the punchline is less surprising. B\u2019s economy and cleverness make it funnier overall."

    "winner": "B",
    "joke_a_score": 6,
    "joke_b_score": 8,
    "reasoning": "B delivers a tight misdirection on \u201conce removed\u201d with a crisp, surprising punchline; it\u2019s compact and clever. A is imaginative and amusing but leans on a familiar setup (\u201cexpect the unexpected\u201d) and feels a bit overwritten compared to B\u2019s clean snap. Wetherspoons is a regional reference, but the twist still lands strongly."

    "winner": "A",
    "joke_a_score": 8,
    "joke_b_score": 5,
    "reasoning": "Joke A\u2019s absurd image (a coffee machine launching into a TED Talk) is vivid, surprising, and ties cleanly to procrastination. Joke B relies on the homophone pun \u201cpoker/poke her,\u201d which feels forced and a bit dark, making it more of a groaner than a laugh."

    "winner": "A",
    "joke_a_score": 8,
    "joke_b_score": 4,
    "reasoning": "Joke A delivers a clever, modern absurdity that subverts the phrase with a vivid TED Talk image and a relatable procrastination jab. Joke B is a straightforward pun on \u201cshocking,\u201d which feels predictable and less inventive."
