    "explanation": "The line maintains the wisdom of the original idiom while undercutting it with a specific, relatable image of over-preparation due to anxiety. The concrete detail of 'extra pair of pants' implies embarrassing accidents, creating a humorous contrast with the philosophical tone of the first half. The 'just in case' adds timing and makes it feel more conversational.",

    "explanation": "The line maintains the spirit of preparedness from the original idiom but creates humor through an absurd circular logic. The first half seems like standard preparedness advice, while the second half reveals an overthinking personality taken to a comically illogical extreme. The parallel structure and specific details (sock drawer, snack drawer) strengthen the comedic effect.",
