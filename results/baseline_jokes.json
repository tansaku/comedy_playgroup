The image of \u201cbabies\u2019 bellies\u201d is vivid and wholesome, and the twist (\u201cany fruit will do\u201d) adds a playful absurdity. However, the logic of extending the idiom beyond raspberries is a bit forced; only \u201craspberry\u201d carries the idiomatic meaning, so broadening to all fruit slightly blunts the precision of the joke. It lands as a light chuckle rather than a big laugh, and it lacks a second beat or escalation that could heighten the surprise.",

The UK-specific reference to Wetherspoons adds cultural color that can help the line land with audiences who recognize the pub and its security culture. Its brevity helps the twist land quickly.
